# markl's dotfiles

This exists mainly for my own purposes. There are doubtless better dotfile repos to look at, such as [this one](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) - I probably wouldn't bother wasting your time looking here.

That said, if you must, feel free!

(This setup assumes zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).)

## To install

The install script will symlink the dotfiles. It will not overwrite any existing files and ask for confirmation.

```
./install.sh
```
