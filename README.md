# markl's dotfiles

This exists mainly for my own purposes, there are doubtless better dotfile repos to look at, such as [this one](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). I probably wouldn't bother wasting your time looking at this one.

That said, if you must, feel free.

## To install

The install script will symlink the dotfiles. It will not overwrite any existing files and ask for confirmation.

```
./install.sh
```
